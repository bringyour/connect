// 1. transfer can now be addressed to/from a stream_id
//    Anywhere transfer would be addressed to a destination_id or from a source_id,
//    it can now be to/from a stream_id.
// 2. stream_ids are created by adding intermediary_destination_ids to CreateContract
// 3. multi-hop state is created with StreamOpen
//    This is sent each time a stream contract is created,
//    so that the hop state can time out the same as the sender state.
